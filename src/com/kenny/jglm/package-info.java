/**
 * A port of <b>GLM </b> library in Java called <b>JGLM</b> as closlly as possible.<br><br>
 * 
 * <b>OpenGL Mathematics (GLM) </b> is a header only C++ mathematics library for graphics software based on the<br>
 * OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) specifications. <br><br>
 * 
 * GLM provides classes and functions designed and implemented with the same naming conventions and <br>
 * functionalities than GLSL so that anyone who knows GLSL, can use GLM as well in C++. <br><br>
 * 
 * This project isn't limited to GLSL features. An extension system, based on the GLSL extension <br>
 * conventions, provides extended capabilities: matrix transformations, quaternions, data packing, <br>
 * random numbers, noise, etc... <br><br>
 * 
 * This library works perfectly with OpenGL but it also ensures interoperability with other third <br>
 * party libraries and SDK. It is a good candidate for software rendering (raytracing / rasterisation),<br>
 * image processing, physic simulations and any development context that requires a simple and <br>
 * convenient mathematics library. <br><br>
 * 
 * GLM is written in C++98 but can take advantage of C++11 when supported by the compiler. It is a <br>
 * platform independent library with no dependence and it officially supports the following <br>
 * compilers:<br>
 * <i><li> Apple Clang 6.0 and higher </li></i>
 * <i><li> GCC 4.7 and higher </li></i>
 * <i><li> Intel C++ Composer XE 2013 and higher </li></i>
 * <i><li> LLVM 3.4 and higher </li></i>
 * <i><li> Visual C++ 2013 and higher </li></i>
 * <i><li> CUDA 9.0 and higher (experimental) </li></i>
 * <i><li> Any conform C++11 compiler </li></i>
 * <br>
 * For more information about GLM, please have a look at the manual and the API reference <br>
 * documentation. <br><br>

 * requests. Any feedback is welcome at glm@g-truc.net. <br><br>
